  Assistant Professor in the [History of Art and Visual
  Culture](https://www.cca.edu/humanities-sciences/history-of-art-and-visual-culture/)
  program at [California College of the Arts](http://cca.edu/)


  [Monica Bravo](mailto:bravo@cca.edu) specializes in the history of photography and the modern art of the Americas. Her first book, *[Greater American Camera: Making Modernism in Mexico](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300253634/greater-american-camera)*, will be published by Yale University Press in June 2021, with support from the Terra and Wyeth Foundations for American Art. The book examines exchanges between U.S. modernist photographers--including Edward Weston, Tina Modotti, Paul Strand, and Helen Levitt--and modern Mexican artists working in painting, poetry, music, photography, and film, resulting in the development of a Greater American modernism in the interwar period. Bravo's research has been supported by fellowships from the [Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA)](https://www.nga.gov/research/casva.html), the [Center for Creative Photography](https://ccp.arizona.edu/), the [Georgia Oâ€™Keeffe Research Center](https://www.okeeffemuseum.org/research-center/), the [Harry Ransom Center](http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/), the [Huntington Library](https://www.huntington.org/library-collections) and [Art Collections](http://www.huntington.org/artcollections/), and the [Terra Foundation for American Art](https://www.terraamericanart.org/).


  Her writing has appeared in *American Art,* *History of Photography*, *[The History of Illustration](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/history-of-illustration-9781501342110/)*, *[caa.reviews](http://www.caareviews.org/reviews/3133%20-%20.Wir2ElWnGUk#.X7CVAZNKjAM)*, *Art Criticism,* and *Panorama: Journal of the Association of Historians of American Art,* for which she co-guest edited an essay collection titled "[Re-Reading American Photographs](https://editions.lib.umn.edu/panorama/article/re-reading-american-photographs/)." Prior to coming to CCA, Bravo was a Lecturer at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) in the [History of Art Department](https://arthistory.yale.edu/) and [Program in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration](https://erm.yale.edu/). She is an inaugural co-chair of [Photography Network](https://www.photographynetwork.net/), a CAA-Affiliated Society.
